Soft “Are you sure?” gate before sending manual G-codes


Safety & fail-safes:
Big red EMERGENCY STOP button (M112 or best available for fw).

Heater guardrail: block >300°C hotend / >130°C bed unless “unlock”.

Safe Z-lift before risky moves incase of collision e.g. Z 100 (e.g., park, filament ops).

“Pre-flight checklist” modal (bed clear? etc)


Temperature & environment:

Live graph of temps + fan speed + M73 %.

Ambient autodetect (you already have plateau logic) shown as a dedicated badge.

Cold extrusion lock warning (if E move while hotend <170°C).

Store/compare PID curves (see #PID) side-by-side.


Motion & axes:
Feedrate override knob (M220) with % display.

Flow override knob (M221) with % display

Velocity/accel/jerk quick tuner (M201/M203/M204/M205 sliders + apply).

Extrusion calibration wizard (E-steps 100mm measure).


PID & calibration:
PID plot: temperature vs time with overshoot/settle metrics graph.

Bed PID vs hotend PID quick tips inline (contextual help).


G-code sender & job control:
Layer-aware preview: quick 2D G-code renderer with scrubber and live “now printing layer” highlight.

G-code preflight analyzer service (time/filament estimates, temp/profile mismatches, unsafe commands).
Spool sufficiency check: compare job estimate vs remaining filament; warn/require confirmation if short.

Chunked file hashing + basic integrity check before send.

Print Queue Panel — queue multiple files, rearrange, auto-start next.

Alerts: browser notifications (and Web Push optional) for finish/error.

Beep/bell on start, beep on finish

Filament usage estimator: parse G-code, subtract from per-spool inventory; warn when a job will exceed remaining.


Maintenance & service:
Nozzle wipe + prime line macro. (heat to 200 with bed of 60)

have one extra filament button on maintance tab which user can set the filament type and tempatures(nozzle/bed)

Fan test (cycle through 0/128/255 and record RPM if available).

Maintenance logbook (notes + dates).

EEPROM / firmware / profiles:
Smart M503 parser to structured fields (steps/mm, accel, etc.).

Firmware flavor detector (Marlin/Klipper/RepRap clues).

Test generator suite: temperature tower, retraction test, acceleration/jerk test—auto-insert height-based changes.

XYZ cube assistant: after you input caliper readings, it computes step/mm or flow correction suggestions.

Thermistor plausibility: reject temps that jump outside of range e.g 300 and negatice values. (warn of thermistor / heater failure)


UI/UX & accessibility:
Mobile-optimized header (stacked pills, bigger taps).

Toast notifications for quick actions.

Inline “why disabled?” tooltips on buttons.

Theming support (light/dark/Custom).

Per-tab “help” drawer with mini docs.

Start/End G-code editors

quickstart guide on first start (guided tooltips)


Filament Tab:
Core fields
Spool ID (auto), Brand, Material (PLA/PETG/ABS/TPU/Nylon/…) (user inputs)

Diameter (1.75 / 2.85), Density (g/cm³; default by material but editable) (user input)

Color + hex, Finish (matte/silk/carbon/glow) (user input)

Tare (empty spool) weight (g) (user input)

Net capacity (labelled, e.g., 1000 g), Cost (total or per-kg) (user input)

Lot/batch, Purchase date, Vendor link (user input)

Weight & usage tracking:

Auto-deduct after print: subtract estimated used grams when a job completes.

G-code usage estimator: parse E-extrusion to compute volume → mass (details below).

Nice UX touches
Spool library list: search, filter by material/color/remaining, sort by “most remaining.”

QR/barcode: print a label (spool ID + QR with all details)

Quick actions: “Weigh now,” “Deduct 5 g purge,” “Mark as empty,”

Unit sanity: disallow negative masses, diameter ≠ 0



Containerized slicer service (CuraEngine/PrusaSlicer CLI) + preset management.

Notification service (email/Slack/Discord/Pushover) with rules (job done, error, temp reached).

Maintenance scheduler (usage counters, hours, cycles)(check belt tension, check nozzle, check bed etc..)

Heater interlocks: require part cooling fan off during PID; block probing while bed > threshold.

ETA v2: hybrid model (path length, extrusion volume, board RTT) with online learning.

Safety heuristics engine: detect dangerous sequences (e.g., Z- move before homing) and block with reason.
